//REPLACE (project in this whole document with the name of your project)

== Get started
//replace company name with the name of your compan
the (company name) APIs are HTTP-based RESTful, request and response bodies are formatted in JSON unless the operation's endpoint specifies otherwise.

IMPORTANT: You cannot run any sample request in this guide as-is. You must replace specific parameters such as tokens or IDs with your own values.

You can find definitions of common API's terms
link:http://apiglossary.com/[here]

== Authentication
'''
//You must explaing here how the authentication works in your api instead of adding that info on each endpoint, next section is a simple example, you will need to complete this part based on the auth of your application.

We are using a JWT token that must be sent as a header on every request, you can obtain this token inside the log in response.

WARNING: Watch out, not having a valid token on the request will give you a failed response with 401 UNAUTHORIZED error code
